TVSlurp
=======
(c) Chris Targett 2010 chris@xlevus.net

A small script that polls a TVRage iCal file, and then searches 
newzbin for aired shows. Found reports are then bookmarked.

It was designed to remove the need to store favourite shows in 
multiple places and to remove the dependency on an external daemon.

Requirements
------------
 * iCalendar - http://pypi.python.org/pypi/icalendar

Setup
-----
Settings are defined in an ini file. The default location is 
`~/tvslurp/config` but this can be changed with the -c flag.

For an example configuration see `example_config`.

Automation can be achieved through a task scheduler such as cron or
windows task scheduler.

Known Issues
------------
 * iCalendar doesn't honour time zones

Notes
-----
A record of recorded episodes is stored in a plaintext file defined
in the config. There is currently no automatic purging of old entries
so this will need to be done manually.
