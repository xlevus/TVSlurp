TVSlurp
=======
(c) Chris Targett 2010 chris@xlevus.net

A small script that polls a TVRage iCal file, and then searches 
newzbin for aired shows. Found reports are then bookmarked.

It was designed to remove the need to store favourite shows in 
multiple places and to remove the dependency on an external daemon.

Requirements
------------
 * iCalendar - http://pypi.python.org/pypi/icalendar

Setup
-----
Settings are defined in an ini file. The default location is 
`~/.tvslurp/config` but this can be changed with the -c flag.

For an example configuration see `example_config`.

Automation can be achieved through a task scheduler such as cron or
windows task scheduler.

Rewrites
--------
In some situations, the name of the show posted to newzbin is
different to the one in the TVRage calendar. 

The [rewrites] section in your TVSlurp config can be used to
rewrite episode titles from the calendar. The format is as follows:

    <key> = <search term> | <replace term>

n.b. Each line in key needs to be unique. 

e.g.
    1 = Newswipe With Charlie Brooker | Newswipe
will turn:
    Newswipe With Charlie Brooker - 1x01
into:
    Newswipe - 1x01


Known Issues
------------
 * iCalendar doesn't honour time zones
 * Specials such as "Lost - S06-Special" will not be found

Notes
-----
A record of recorded episodes is stored in a plaintext file defined
in the config. There is currently no automatic purging of old entries
so this will need to be done manually.
